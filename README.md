# Rick and Morty Angular

This project was created to test my Angular skills by consuming the Rick and
Morty REST API

## Setup

Install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Start the development server (localhost on port 4200 by default. It may vary):

```bash
npm start
```

No additional configuration needed (e.g. API keys).

## Styles

For styling was used Tailwind CSS with SASS (scss).
